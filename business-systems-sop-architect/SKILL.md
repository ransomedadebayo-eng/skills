## Core Capabilities

### 1. SOP Creation

**Standard SOP Template:**

```
SOP: [Process Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PURPOSE
[Why this process exists and what it accomplishes]

SCOPE
[When this SOP applies and when it doesn't]

ROLES
- Owner: [Person responsible for process quality]
- Performer: [Person who executes the process]
- Approver: [Person who signs off (if applicable)]

FREQUENCY
[How often: Daily, Weekly, Per event, As needed]

DURATION
[Estimated time to complete]

TOOLS/RESOURCES NEEDED
- [Tool 1]
- [Tool 2]
- [Template/document needed]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROCEDURE

STEP 1: [Action verb] [what to do]
- Details: [Specific instructions]
- Tips: [Best practices or watch-outs]
- Output: [What this step produces]

STEP 2: [Action verb] [what to do]
- Details: [Specific instructions]
- Tips: [Best practices or watch-outs]
- Output: [What this step produces]

[Continue for all steps]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUALITY CHECKS
□ [Checkpoint 1]
□ [Checkpoint 2]
□ [Checkpoint 3]

SUCCESS CRITERIA
[How you know the process was completed successfully]

COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING
- Issue: [Problem]
  Solution: [How to resolve]

REVISION HISTORY
- v1.0 [Date] - [Your Name] - Initial creation
```

### 2. Process Mapping

**Flowchart Components:**

- **Start/End**: Oval shapes
- **Process Step**: Rectangle
- **Decision Point**: Diamond
- **Document**: Paper shape
- **Data/System**: Parallelogram

**Example Text-Based Flow:**

```
START
  ↓
[Receive booking inquiry]
  ↓
<Is date available?> ───NO───> [Send regrets + suggest alternatives] → END
  ↓ YES
[Send pricing & availability]
  ↓
<Client confirms?> ───NO───> [Follow up in 3 days] → END
  ↓ YES
[Send contract]
  ↓
[Receive signed contract + deposit]
  ↓
[Add to calendar]
  ↓
[Send confirmation email]
  ↓
END
```

### 3. Checklist Design

**Checklist Best Practices:**

- Use action verbs ("Confirm," "Send," "Review")
- Break complex tasks into small steps
- Add time estimates
- Include links to templates or tools
- Build in quality checks

**Example Checklist:**

```
PRE-EVENT CHECKLIST: Band Performance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2 WEEKS BEFORE:
□ Confirm date/time with venue contact
□ Share setlist with band members
□ Test all equipment (15 min)
□ Confirm transportation arrangements

1 WEEK BEFORE:
□ Send reminder to venue contact
□ Rehearse full setlist with band (2 hrs)
□ Check weather (outdoor events)
□ Pack equipment (use packing list)

DAY BEFORE:
□ Final confirmation call/email with venue
□ Charge all wireless units
□ Print setlist (3 copies)
□ Load vehicle with gear

DAY OF (4 hours before):
□ Load in to venue (arrive 2 hrs early)
□ Sound check (45 min)
□ Band meal break
□ Final check of equipment

POST-EVENT:
□ Pack up all equipment (use packing list)
□ Thank venue contact
□ Collect payment (if not paid upfront)
□ Request testimonial/review
□ Log performance notes for future reference
```

### 4. Automation Identification

I identify opportunities to automate using:

**Tools:**
- **Zapier/Make**: Connect apps without code
- **Google Workspace**: Sheets, Forms, Scripts
- **Notion**: Databases with automations
- **Airtable**: Database with built-in automations
- **Calendly/Acuity**: Scheduling automation
- **Email**: Templates, canned responses, filters

**Common Automation Patterns:**

| Manual Task | Automation Solution |
|------------|---------------------|
| Copy data between apps | Zapier integration |
| Send follow-up emails | Email drip sequence |
| Schedule meetings | Calendly booking |
| Create invoices | Auto-generate from form submission |
| Update spreadsheets | Google Sheets formulas + Zapier |
| Social media posting | Buffer/Hootsuite scheduling |
| File organization | Google Drive folder rules |

### 5. Role Assignment Matrix

**RACI for Each Process:**

| Task | Person A | Person B | Person C |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Task 1 | R | A | I |
| Task 2 | C | R | A |

- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (approves)
- **C** = Consulted (gives input)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated)

## Example SOPs for Common Workflows

## System Design Principles

### 1. Keep It Simple
- The best system is one that gets used
- Start basic, add complexity only as needed
- Use familiar tools (don't over-engineer)

### 2. Build for Handoff
- Document as if someone else will run it
- Include screenshots and examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"

### 3. Make It Measurable
- Define success metrics
- Track key numbers (conversion rate, time to complete, error rate)
- Review and iterate quarterly

### 4. Reduce Friction
- Minimize steps
- Use templates and checklists
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Keep tools in one place

### 5. Version Control
- Date and version all SOPs
- Note what changed and why
- Review annually

## Notion Template Structures

- Fee (Number)
- Deposit Received (Checkbox)
- Venue (Text)
- Contact Person (Text)
- Notes (Long text)

**Views:**
- Calendar view (by Event Date)
- Pipeline view (by Status)
- Upcoming Events (Filter: Status = Confirmed, Date > Today)
- Revenue Report (Table showing fees by month)

### Database Schema for Content Calendar

**Properties:**

- Topic/Theme (Select)
- Primary Platform (Select: Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Publish Date (Date)
- Status (Select: Idea, In Progress, Scheduled, Published)

## Common Processes to Systematize

1. **Customer Onboarding**: New client intake process
2. **Invoicing**: From service delivery to payment
3. **Content Creation**: Idea to publication
4. **Event Preparation**: Pre-event checklists
5. **Financial Close**: Month-end financial review
6. **Employee/Contractor Onboarding**: Getting new help up to speed
7. **Maintenance Tasks**: Regular upkeep activities
8. **Customer Support**: Handling inquiries and issues

## Getting Started

To build an SOP:
1. Describe the process you do repeatedly
2. Walk me through how you currently do it
3. Identify pain points or inconsistencies
4. Tell me who else might need to do this process
5. I'll create a documented SOP with automation suggestions

This skill will help you work ON your business, not just IN your business, by systematizing repeated workflows.
