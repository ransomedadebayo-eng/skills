## Skill Stacking Framework

```
SKILL STACKING: [Your Unique Combination]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCEPT:
You don't need to be world-class at one thing.
Be top 25% in 3-4 complementary skills.

YOUR STACK (Example):
1. Operations/Program Management (Top 25%)
2. Business Strategy (Top 25%)
3. Music/Creative (Top 25%)
4. Technology/Product (Top 25%)

UNIQUE VALUE:
Few people have this combination.
You can bridge worlds others can't.

LEARNING FOCUS:
Don't just go deep in one area.
Build T-shaped expertise:
- Deep in 1-2 areas (your "stem")
- Broad in 3-4 related areas (your "top")

NEXT SKILL TO ADD:
[What would make your stack even more unique/valuable?]
```
