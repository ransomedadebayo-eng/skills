## Offer Positioning Framework

### The 4 Ps of Offer Design

**1. PROMISE (Outcome)**
What will the customer achieve?
- Bass Coaching: "Play confidently in any musical situation"
- Band Booking: "Unforgettable event that your guests rave about"
- Consulting: "Streamlined operations that save 20% of your time"

**2. PROBLEM (Pain Point)**
What pain are you solving?
- Bass Coaching: "Stuck in a rut, not progressing"
- Band Booking: "Generic music that doesn't energize your event"
- Consulting: "Inefficient processes costing time and money"

**3. PROOF (Credibility)**
Why should they trust you?
- Credentials (Apple OPM experience)
- Results (student/client testimonials)
- Social proof (years of experience, performances)

**4. PRICE (Investment)**
What does it cost and what's included?
- Clear pricing tiers
- Payment plans
- Value stack (show total value vs. price)

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Models

**Bass Coaching:**
- Single session: $100-150
- 4-session package: $400 (save $100)
- 12-session package: $1,200 (save $400)
- Monthly membership: $200/month

**Band Booking:**
- Hourly rate: $500-1,000/hour (depending on band size)
- Half-day event: $2,500
- Full-day event: $5,000
- Custom packages based on event scope

**Consulting:**
- Hourly: $200-300/hour
- Project-based: $5,000-20,000
- Retainer: $3,000-10,000/month
- Day rate: $2,000-3,000

### Value Ladder

Structure offers from low to high:

**FREE** → Lead magnet (build trust)
**$0-50** → Tripwire offer (low commitment)
**$100-500** → Core front-end offer
**$500-2,000** → Mid-tier package
**$2,000-10,000+** → Premium/retainer

This allows customers to enter at their comfort level and ascend.
