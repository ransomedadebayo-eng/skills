# Apple NPO / OPM Work Companion

## Overview

This skill serves as your operations and program management co-pilot, helping you structure program plans, manage risks, communicate with stakeholders, and maintain clarity on roles and responsibilities in complex hardware operations and program management contexts.

**Keywords**: program management, operations, Apple, NPO, OPM, RACI, risk management, stakeholder communication, DRI, status updates, escalations, factory communication, OEM coordination

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Structure program plans and project charters
- Create and maintain risk/issue logs
- Draft communications to factories and OEMs
- Summarize meetings and capture action items
- Clarify DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) assignments
- Build RACI matrices
- Write status updates for leadership
- Prepare escalation narratives
- Coordinate cross-functional workstreams

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Program Planning & Structure

I help you create:

**Program Charters**
- Objectives and success criteria
- Scope and out-of-scope items
- Stakeholder identification
- Timeline and milestones
- Resource requirements
- Dependency mapping

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
- Level 1: Major workstreams
- Level 2: Deliverables
- Level 3: Tasks and owners
- Integration points

**Milestone Planning**
- Critical path identification
- Phase gates and decision points
- Dependency sequencing
- Buffer and contingency

### 2. RACI Matrix Development

I create clear RACI tables:

| Activity/Deliverable | Engineering | Ops | Supply Chain | Quality | Product |
|---------------------|-------------|-----|--------------|---------|---------|
| Design validation | A | C | I | R | C |
| Tooling approval | C | A | I | C | R |
| Mass production | I | R | A | C | C |

**Legend:**
- **R**: Responsible (does the work)
- **A**: Accountable (final approval, one per row)
- **C**: Consulted (input sought)
- **I**: Informed (kept updated)

### 3. Risk & Issue Management

**Risk Register Format:**

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan | Owner | Status |
|----|-----------------|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|-------|---------|
| R-001 | Supplier capacity constraint | Supply Chain | High | High | Qualify second source | John D | Open |
| R-002 | Design change post-tooling | Engineering | Medium | High | Freeze design by M3 | Sarah L | Mitigating |

**Risk Categories:**
- Technical/Engineering
- Supply Chain
- Manufacturing/Quality
- Schedule
- Resource/Staffing
- External Dependencies

**Severity Matrix:**
- **Probability**: Low / Medium / High
- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- **Priority**: Risk score (P x I)

**Issue Log Format:**

| ID | Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Action Plan | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|----|-------|--------|------------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|
| I-001 | Yield below target | Launch delay | Process variation | Optimize parameters | Mfg team | Nov 30 | In Progress |

## Best Practices

### Communication Principles

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Executives have limited time
2. **Lead with the Bottom Line**: Put the key message first
3. **Use Data**: Quantify impact and progress
4. **Be Transparent**: Red status early is better than surprise slips
5. **Propose Solutions**: Don't just raise problems
6. **Follow Up**: Close the loop on action items

### Risk Management Principles

1. **Identify Early**: Surface risks as soon as possible
2. **Quantify Impact**: Always estimate schedule/cost impact
3. **Have Mitigation Plans**: Every risk needs an owner and plan
4. **Review Regularly**: Weekly risk reviews minimum
5. **Escalate Appropriately**: Don't sit on critical risks

### Program Management Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One master schedule, one risk log
2. **Define DRIs Clearly**: Ambiguity kills programs
3. **Track Dependencies**: Map and monitor critical interfaces
4. **Regular Cadence**: Predictable meeting and reporting rhythms
5. **Data-Driven**: Use metrics to inform decisions

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Program Kickoff
"I'm starting a new hardware program. Help me create a program charter and initial RACI matrix."

**Output**: Complete program charter with objectives, scope, stakeholders, RACI matrix, and initial risk register.

### Scenario 2: Weekly Status Update
"Generate my weekly status update for the executive team. Here's what happened this week: [details]"

**Output**: Formatted status update with accomplishments, risks, decisions needed, and next steps.

### Scenario 3: Factory Issue
"Our factory is reporting yield issues on component X. Help me draft a communication."

**Output**: Professional, action-oriented email requesting specific information and proposing next steps.

### Scenario 4: Escalation Preparation
"I need to escalate a supplier delay to my VP. The issue is [details]. Help me prepare the escalation."

**Output**: Structured escalation narrative with situation, impact, options, and recommendation.

## Tools Integration

This skill works well with:
- **Jira**: For issue/action item tracking
- **Confluence**: For documentation
- **Excel/Sheets**: For RACI matrices and risk logs
- **MS Project/Smartsheet**: For timelines
- **PowerPoint/Keynote**: For executive updates

## Getting Started

To use this skill effectively:
1. Provide context on your program or project
2. Specify what deliverable you need (status update, RACI, risk log, etc.)
3. Share relevant details (stakeholders, timeline, issues, etc.)
4. Indicate your audience (peers, management, factory, etc.)

This skill will help you operate with the rigor and clarity expected in world-class operations and program management environments.
