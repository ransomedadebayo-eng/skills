- Risk-adjusted return
- Opportunity cost

#### 3. **Capacity Lens**
Do you have the bandwidth?
- Time required (hours/week)

## Risk Matrix

I'll plot opportunities on a 2x2 risk matrix:

```
        HIGH RETURN
            │
            │  [High Risk,      [Low Risk,
            │   High Return]     High Return]
            │   "Swing for       "No-Brainer"
            │    Fences"         "Green Light"
            │
            │
HIGH RISK ──┼─────────────────── LOW RISK
            │
            │  [High Risk,      [Low Risk,
            │   Low Return]      Low Return]
            │   "Avoid"          "Not Worth It"
            │
            │
        LOW RETURN
```

**Decision Framework by Quadrant:**

- **Low Risk, High Return (Upper Right)**: GO - Prioritize these
- **High Risk, High Return (Upper Left)**: HOLD - Only if you have bandwidth and risk tolerance
- **Low Risk, Low Return (Lower Right)**: HOLD - Consider if strategic value exists
- **High Risk, Low Return (Lower Left)**: KILL - Avoid these

## Decision Frameworks

### ICE Score (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

Rate each from 1-10:
- **Impact**: How much will this move the needle?
- **Confidence**: How sure are you it will work?
- **Ease**: How easy is it to execute?

**ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

Prioritize opportunities with highest ICE scores.

### RICE Score (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

- **Reach**: How many people/areas affected?
- **Impact**: How significant is the change?
- **Confidence**: How certain are you?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

### Expected Value Calculation

**EV = (Probability of Success × Upside) - (Probability of Failure × Downside)**

Example:
- 30% chance of $100k return
- 70% chance of $20k loss
- EV = (0.3 × $100k) - (0.7 × $20k) = $30k - $14k = $16k positive EV

### Regret Minimization Framework

Ask: "Will I regret not trying this when I'm 80?"
- High regret if you don't try → Strong signal to GO
- Low regret if you don't try → Easier to KILL

## Special Evaluation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Passion Project with Low ROI

**Example**: Recording an album that won't be profitable

**Evaluation Approach:**
- Separate financial from non-financial returns
- Assess "psychic income" (fulfillment, legacy)
- Set a budget cap to contain downside
- Look for creative ways to improve economics
- Decide if the non-financial return is worth the cost

**Decision Framework:**
If purpose alignment is 5/5 and you can afford it, consider GO even with low financial return.

### Scenario 2: High-Paying Opportunity with Purpose Misalignment

**Example**: Lucrative consulting gig that drains your soul

**Evaluation Approach:**
- Quantify the financial benefit
- Assess the opportunity cost (what else could you do with that time?)
- Consider if it's a short-term means to a long-term end
- Evaluate health/relationship/fulfillment costs
- Set a time limit if you proceed

**Decision Framework:**
Only GO if it's short-term and enables a longer-term purpose-aligned move.

### Scenario 3: Capacity Crunch

**Example**: Great opportunity but you're already overcommitted

**Evaluation Approach:**
- Force a trade-off: What will you stop doing?
- Assess if this is truly better than current commitments
- Consider delegation or outsourcing
- Evaluate if timing can shift (HOLD for later)

**Decision Framework:**
If this is 2x better than your current lowest-priority commitment, swap them. Otherwise, HOLD or KILL.

## Comparison Matrix

When evaluating multiple opportunities simultaneously:

| Opportunity | Purpose | Financial | Capacity | Strategic | Execution | Total | Verdict |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Option A | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 18/25 | HOLD |
| Option B | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 17/25 | HOLD |
| Option C | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 22/25 | GO |

This helps you see trade-offs and make relative decisions.

## Common Biases to Avoid

1. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Don't pursue because you've already invested
2. **Shiny Object Syndrome**: Don't chase every new thing
3. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: There will always be more opportunities
4. **Overconfidence**: Be realistic about risks and challenges
5. **Present Bias**: Don't sacrifice long-term for short-term gain
6. **Confirmation Bias**: Seek disconfirming evidence, not just supportive

## Example Evaluations

### Example 1: Bass Coaching Business

**Opportunity**: Launch online bass coaching service

**Deal Memo Highlights:**
- Investment: $2k (website, equipment, marketing)
- Time: 10 hrs/week
- Expected Return: $2k-5k/month within 6 months
- Purpose Alignment: 5/5 (music + teaching + service)
- Financial Viability: 4/5 (solid unit economics)
- Capacity Fit: 3/5 (manageable but tight)
- Strategic Value: 4/5 (builds brand, diversifies income)
- Execution Feasibility: 4/5 (you have the skills)

**Verdict**: GO (with condition of starting part-time and scaling as demand grows)

### Example 2: MBA Program

**Opportunity**: Part-time MBA at top school

**Deal Memo Highlights:**
- Investment: $150k tuition + 20 hrs/week for 2 years
- Expected Return: Career acceleration, $30k salary bump, network
- Purpose Alignment: 3/5 (enables impact but time away from family)
- Financial Viability: 3/5 (positive NPV but long payback)
- Capacity Fit: 1/5 (very challenging with new baby)
- Strategic Value: 5/5 (unlocks exec roles)
- Execution Feasibility: 3/5 (doable but hard)

**Verdict**: HOLD (wait 2-3 years until child is older; pursue strategy courses online in the meantime)

### Example 3: App Development

**Opportunity**: Build CRM app for mom's pharmacy

**Deal Memo Highlights:**
- Investment: 200 hours development time
- Expected Return: Non-financial (help family, learn new skills)
- Purpose Alignment: 5/5 (family service)
- Financial Viability: 1/5 (no direct income)
- Capacity Fit: 2/5 (lots of time)
- Strategic Value: 3/5 (skill building, potential to sell to other pharmacies)
- Execution Feasibility: 4/5 (technical skills adequate)

**Verdict**: GO (as a side project with no time pressure; could become commercial product later)

## Getting Started

To evaluate an opportunity:
1. Describe the opportunity in 2-3 sentences
2. Share what resources it requires (money, time, etc.)
3. Tell me what you hope to get out of it
4. Provide any context on your current situation and goals
5. I'll generate a complete deal memo with recommendation

This skill will help you make clear, confident decisions about where to invest your limited time, energy, and capital.
