- Learn about tax-advantaged savings vehicles (HSA, 529)
- Explore advanced strategies (mega backdoor Roth, tax-loss harvesting)

## Core Tax-Advantaged Accounts

### 1. 401(k) - Traditional vs. Roth

**Traditional 401(k)**
- Contributions: Pre-tax (reduces current taxable income)
- Growth: Tax-deferred
- Withdrawals: Taxed as ordinary income
- Best for: High earners expecting lower tax rate in retirement

**Roth 401(k)**
- Contributions: After-tax (no immediate deduction)
- Growth: Tax-free
- Withdrawals: Tax-free (if qualified)
- Best for: Lower earners or those expecting higher tax rate in retirement

**2025 Contribution Limits:**
- Employee: $23,000 (under 50) / $30,500 (50+)
- Total (employee + employer): $69,000 / $76,500 (50+)

**Decision Tree:**
```
Are you in a high tax bracket now (24%+)?
├─ YES → Traditional 401(k) (tax savings now)
│   └─ Do you also want Roth exposure?
│       └─ YES → Consider mega backdoor Roth (see below)
│
└─ NO → Consider Roth 401(k) (tax-free later)
    └─ Expecting big income increase soon?
        └─ YES → Roth now while in lower bracket
```

### 2. HSA (Health Savings Account)

**The "Triple Tax Advantage":**
1. Contributions: Tax-deductible
2. Growth: Tax-free
3. Withdrawals: Tax-free (for qualified medical expenses)

**2025 Contribution Limits:**
- Individual: $4,300
- Family: $8,550
- Catch-up (55+): +$1,000

**Eligibility:**
- Must have High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
- Cannot be enrolled in Medicare
- Cannot be claimed as a dependent

**Strategy:**
- Contribute maximum amount
- Invest the funds (don't just let it sit in cash)
- Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket if possible
- Save receipts indefinitely (can reimburse yourself years later)
- Treat as a "stealth IRA" for retirement

**Why it's powerful:**
- Better than 401(k) if used for medical expenses (no tax ever)
- Can be used for retirement (taxed like traditional IRA after age 65)
- No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

### 3. Mega Backdoor Roth

**What is it?**
A strategy to contribute up to $46,000 additional to Roth accounts beyond the normal $23,000 401(k) limit.

**Requirements:**
✓ Your 401(k) plan allows:
  - After-tax contributions (beyond Roth 401k)
  - In-service distributions or in-plan Roth conversions
✓ You have income to contribute after maxing employee limit

**How it works:**
```
Step 1: Max out employee 401(k) contribution ($23,000)
Step 2: Make after-tax contributions to 401(k)
   (Up to $69,000 total limit minus employee + employer contributions)
Step 3: Immediately convert after-tax to Roth
   (Via in-service distribution to Roth IRA or in-plan conversion)
Step 4: Pay tax on any gains between contribution and conversion
```

**Example:**
- Employee contribution: $23,000
- Employer match: $10,000
- Remaining space: $69,000 - $23,000 - $10,000 = $36,000
- You contribute $36,000 after-tax → immediately convert to Roth
- Result: $36,000 additional Roth savings

**Questions for your CPA:**
- Does my 401(k) plan allow after-tax contributions?
- Does my plan allow in-service distributions or in-plan conversions?
- Should I do this given my income and tax situation?

### 4. Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA

**Traditional IRA**
- Deductibility depends on income and whether you have a 401(k)
- 2025 limit: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- Phase-out for deductibility if covered by workplace plan:
  * Single: $79,000-$89,000
  * Married: $126,000-$146,000

**Roth IRA**
- No tax deduction
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- Income limits (2025):
  * Single: $150,000-$165,000
  * Married: $236,000-$246,000

**Backdoor Roth IRA:**
If income too high for direct Roth contribution:
1. Contribute to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Immediately convert to Roth IRA
3. Pay tax on gains (minimal if immediate)

**Watch out for:**
- Pro-rata rule if you have existing Traditional IRA balances

### 5. 529 Plan (Education Savings)

**Benefits:**
- Contributions: After-tax (but California offers no state deduction)
- Growth: Tax-free
- Withdrawals: Tax-free for qualified education expenses
- Some states offer state tax deduction (not CA)

**2025 Rules:**
- No federal contribution limit (gift tax applies >$18,000/year/beneficiary)
- Can change beneficiary to another family member
- Can roll up to $35,000 to beneficiary's Roth IRA (new rule, restrictions apply)

**Qualified Expenses:**
- Tuition, fees, books
- Room and board (if enrolled at least half-time)
- K-12 tuition (up to $10,000/year)
- Student loan repayment (up to $10,000 lifetime)

**California Considerations:**
- No state tax deduction for contributions
- Still benefits from tax-free growth
- Consider front-loading with 5-year election ($90,000 lump sum)

### 6. FSA (Flexible Spending Account)

**Healthcare FSA:**
- 2025 limit: $3,200
- Use-it-or-lose-it (some plans allow $640 carryover or 2.5-month grace period)
- Pre-tax contributions

**Dependent Care FSA:**
- 2025 limit: $5,000
- For childcare expenses
- Coordinate with Child Care Tax Credit

**Decision:**
```
Do you have predictable medical expenses?
├─ YES → Contribute to Healthcare FSA
│   └─ Have HDHP with HSA?
│       ├─ YES → CANNOT contribute to Healthcare FSA (conflict)
│       └─ NO → FSA can make sense
│
└─ NO → Don't contribute (risk losing money)

Do you pay for childcare?
├─ YES → Max out Dependent Care FSA ($5,000)
│   (Almost always better than Child Care Tax Credit)
└─ NO → Don't contribute
```

## California-Specific Tax Considerations

### State Income Tax
- California has highest state income tax (up to 13.3%)
- No special capital gains rate (taxed as ordinary income)
- State tax is deductible on federal (up to $10,000 SALT cap)

### California Retirement Account Rules
- 401(k), IRA contributions reduce California taxable income
- Roth conversions are taxable for CA state (not just federal)
- 529 plans: No state tax deduction (unlike many other states)

### Real Estate in California
- Property taxes capped at 1% + local assessments (Prop 13)
- Reassessed at sale (can be significant increase)
- Primary residence exclusion: $250k single / $500k married capital gains

### Moving Out of California
- Establish domicile in new state carefully
- CA may claim you're still resident if you maintain ties
- Roth conversions might be better after establishing residency in low/no tax state

## Advanced Strategies

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
**What:** Sell investments at a loss to offset capital gains

**Rules:**
- Can offset unlimited capital gains
- Can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income
- Excess losses carry forward indefinitely
- Watch for wash sale rule (can't rebuy same/substantially identical security within 30 days)

**When to do it:**
- Year-end (before Dec 31)
- After market corrections
- When rebalancing anyway

### Roth Conversion Ladder
**Strategy:** Convert Traditional IRA to Roth in low-income years

**Best for:**
- Years between jobs
- Early retirement (before Social Security)
- Years with big deductions/losses

**Process:**
1. Identify low-income year
2. Convert amount that fills up lower tax brackets
3. Pay tax on conversion
4. Money available tax-free in 5 years (if under 59.5)

**Example:**
- Year you take sabbatical
- Income: $50,000 (vs. normal $150,000)
- Convert $40,000 Traditional → Roth
- Pay tax at lower rate (likely 12-22% vs. normal 24-32%)

### Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD)
**Age 70.5+:**
- Can donate up to $105,000/year directly from IRA to charity
- Counts toward RMD but not included in taxable income
- Better than taking distribution and donating (lowers AGI)

### Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)
**Strategy:** Bunch multiple years of charitable giving into one year

**Process:**
1. Contribute appreciated stock to DAF (get deduction now)
2. Avoid capital gains tax on appreciation
3. Donate from DAF over multiple years

**Best for:**
- High-income years
- Large charitable goals
- Appreciated stock positions

## Employer Benefit Decision Trees

### Open Enrollment Decisions

**Health Insurance:**
```
Do you have high medical expenses?
├─ YES → PPO or lower deductible plan
│   (Even if higher premium)
│
└─ NO/UNSURE → HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan)
    ├─ Benefit: Lower premiums
    ├─ Benefit: HSA eligibility (triple tax advantage)
    └─ Risk: Higher out-of-pocket if unexpected medical needs
```

**Life Insurance:**
```
Do you have dependents?
├─ YES → How much employer coverage?
│   └─ Calculate need: 10-12x income
│       └─ Shortfall?
│           ├─ YES → Purchase term life insurance
│           └─ NO → Employer coverage sufficient
│
└─ NO → Employer basic coverage likely sufficient
```

## Year-End Tax Planning Checklist
