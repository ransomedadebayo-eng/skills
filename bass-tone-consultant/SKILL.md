## Common Issues & Solutions

```
PROBLEM: Too boomy/muddy
SOLUTION: Cut 200-400 Hz, high-pass filter @ 40-60 Hz

PROBLEM: Lost in the mix
SOLUTION: Boost 800 Hz - 1.5 kHz, add compression

PROBLEM: Harsh/clicky
SOLUTION: Roll off highs above 5-6 kHz

PROBLEM: Weak low end
SOLUTION: Boost 60-100 Hz, check bass/pickup

PROBLEM: Inconsistent volume
SOLUTION: Increase compression ratio/threshold
```
