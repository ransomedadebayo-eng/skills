```

GOAL vs CAPACITY: Reality Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR GOALS & TIME NEEDED

1. Music (bass practice + gigs):  10 hrs/week
2. App development project:        8 hrs/week

Your Available Capacity:          17 hrs/week

GAP: -21 hours (121% over capacity)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VERDICT: Significantly overcommitted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. CUT: Choose 2-3 goals max
2. SEQUENCE: Do some now, others later
3. REDUCE: Lower time commitment per goal
```

## Priority Sequencing Framework

```
GOAL SEQUENCING: [Time Period]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NOW (This Quarter)
Focus: [Goal 1]
Time: 10-12 hrs/week
Why: [Rationale - urgency, season, impact]

Maintain: [Goal 2]
Time: 3-4 hrs/week
Why: [Rationale - can't pause completely]

NEXT (Following Quarter)
Focus: [Goal 3]
Rationale: [Why this timing makes sense]

LATER (6-12 months out)
Deferred: [Goal 4]
Rationale: [Why it can wait]

NOT NOW (Paused indefinitely)
Paused: [Goal 5]
Rationale: [Why it doesn't fit current season]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PHILOSOPHY:
"You can have it all, just not all at once."
Do fewer things better, rather than many things poorly.
```

## Time Blocking Strategies

```
TIME BLOCKING BEST PRACTICES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THEME DAYS (Alternative to daily blocks)
Monday: Focus Day (deep work on one project)
Tuesday: Meeting Day (all calls/collabs)
Wednesday: Admin Day (catch-up, planning)
Thursday: Create Day (writing, building)
Friday: Flex Day (whatever needs attention)

BATCH SIMILAR TASKS
- All meetings on same day
- All creative work in AM blocks
- All admin in PM blocks

PROTECT MARGINS
- No meetings before 9 AM or after 4 PM
- Leave 30-min buffer between commitments
- Block "No Meeting Fridays" for deep work

USE CONSTRAINTS
- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill time
- Set tight time boxes (1 hr max per task)
- Use timer to stay focused

ENERGY MANAGEMENT
High energy (AM): Complex, creative work
Medium energy (midday): Meetings, collaboration
Low energy (PM): Admin, email, routine tasks
```

## Cut/Keep/Sequence Decision Matrix

```
DECISION MATRIX: What to Cut, Keep, or Sequence
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For each goal, rate:
- Impact (1-5): How much it moves the needle
- Urgency (1-5): Can it wait?
- Enjoyment (1-5): Do you love it?
- Season Fit (1-5): Does it fit your current life stage?

EXAMPLE:

Goal: Online MBA
Impact: 5 (career advancement)
Urgency: 2 (can wait 2 years)
Enjoyment: 3 (means to an end)
Season Fit: 1 (terrible timing with new baby)
Total: 11/20 → SEQUENCE (do in 2-3 years)

Goal: Bass Practice
Impact: 3 (important but not income-critical)
Urgency: 3 (skills atrophy if paused)
Enjoyment: 5 (love it)
Season Fit: 4 (can fit in mornings)
Total: 15/20 → KEEP (maintain mode, 3-4 hrs/week)

Goal: App for Mom's Pharmacy
Impact: 4 (helps family + learning)
Urgency: 2 (no hard deadline)
Enjoyment: 4 (enjoy building)
Season Fit: 3 (manageable in evenings)
Total: 13/20 → KEEP (active project, 5-6 hrs/week)

Goal: Side Consulting
Impact: 4 (income + network)
Urgency: 1 (not needed financially)
Enjoyment: 2 (draining)
Season Fit: 1 (terrible timing)
Total: 8/20 → CUT (pause indefinitely)
```

## Getting Started

Share:
1. Your non-negotiable commitments (work, family, sleep)
2. Your current goals and ambitions
3. Constraints (new baby, commute, etc.)

I'll build a realistic capacity model and schedule.
